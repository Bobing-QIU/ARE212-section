    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through part of the subsection \"Convolution Continuous and Discrete Random variables\" in the [random_variables0.ipynb](https://github.com/ligonteaching/ARE212_Materials/blob/master/random_variables0.ipynb) notebook. The goal of this section is to create a new random variable that is the sum of a continuous random variable $X$ and a discrete random variable $S$ so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y = X+S$\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will create a new class that _inherits_ from an already existing class: ``iid.rv_continuous``. So, what is inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is when we define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. The class being inherited from (in this case, ``iid.rv_continuous``), is called the _parent_ or _base_ class. The class that inherits is the _child_ or _derived_ class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we had a class called ``Student``, that like in our past class, has attributes like ``Student.grades`` and ``Student.studentID``, and methods such as ``Student.calculateGPA()``. But we also might want to be more specific about what kind of student we are talking about. So we could create a child class called ``GraduateStudent`` that inherits all these attributes and methods from ``Student``, but also adds some like ``GraduateStudent.dissertationChair`` or ``GraduateStudent.fields``.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the beauty of inheritance; instead of programming grades attributes for all sorts of student types, we just inherit this structure for all subtypes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This is what Ethan is doing in his convolution class: he knows the convolution will be continuous, so he inherits the structure from the ``iid.rv_continuous`` class, and makes some modifications to make the class convolution-specific.**"

    "### Implementing inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Tell python who you want to inherit from**\n",
    "Telling python \"who\" (what class) you are inheriting from is straightforward: just make the class definition a function of the parent class! Ethan does this in this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "``class ConvolvedContinuousAndDiscrete(iid.rv_continuous):``\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Inheriting methods, attributes frm the parent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work isn't quite over though. Remember: the constructor makes the class. So we want to put a method in the constructor that instructs it to bring in all the methods and attributes from the parent class. This is done with the line:\n",

    "``super(ConvolvedContinuousAndDiscrete, self).__init__(name=\"ConvolvedContinuousAndDiscrete\")``\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry too much about the name part; he's just renaming the class and this could have been omitted. Let's play around with different iterations on this code to get a feel for what's going on:"
